            <p>
                One day I was browsing Twitter very unmerrily (as one does) when I came across <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/cremetoursBA/status/1380134261001490435"
                    title="Tweet about the picture I was inspired by">this tweet</a>. It caught my attention how it
                described something so ordinary to me as peculiar to a certain particular artistic movement. So I looked
                at the picture and two things happened. My first thought was how much beauty there must be around us
                which is lost on us as it becomes no more than background noise in our day to day lives.
            </p>
            <p>

                My second thought was "I could probably CSS that".
            </p>
            <p> This was my first experiment with 3D CSS transformations, so I'll probably come to revisit this code
                later and tidy it up here and there. The <i>feel</i> of the wall behind isn't quite right, and the
                stairs aren't in the right height, but I'm very proud of that handle.

                I'm afraid there's also a little javascript here doing some heavy lifting, as I couldn't figure out how
                to generate a bazillion tiles with a random distribution of colours.
