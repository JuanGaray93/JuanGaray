                I created this absolutely over-engineered project at a time when I was only starting to learn Typescript
                and I was experimenting with a particular front-end architecture meant for far larger projects than a
                simple, static app.
            </p>
            <p> I ended up creating a playable, responsive game which I find myself playing when I'm looking at my old
                projects.
