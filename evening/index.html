            <p>I took this picture one afternoon just to recreate it in CSS later. I knew I'd try to use the
            <pre>clip-path</pre> property to create the buildings against the evening sky, as I had used that
            property to reshape the railing in <a href="https://juangaray93.github.io/juangaray/venecitas/">my
                Venecitas sketch</a>.
            I decided I'd try something different this time around so I took this oportunity to learn about SVG,
            which I didn't quite master yet.</p>
